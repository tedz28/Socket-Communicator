
  Demonstrate Base64 Encoding and Decoding 
 ==========================================

  original: We're not in Kansas anymore, Toto!
  encoded:  V2UncmUgbm90IGluIEthbnNhcyBhbnltb3JlLCBUb3RvIQ==
  decoded:  We're not in Kansas anymore, Toto!

  creating encoded string from binary file debug\Base64Encoding.exe

  First fifty bytes of encoded string:
  TVqQAAMAAAAEAAAA//8AALgAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

  writing decoded string to binary file debug\temp.exe

  Use fc to demonstrate that debug\Base64Encoding.exe
  is identical to debug\temp.exe
